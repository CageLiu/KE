# jQuery.Syntax [release-3.0] #

jQuery.Syntax is a light-weight client-side syntax highlighter, which dynamically loads external dependencies (JavaScript & CSS) when required. It uses jQuery to make it cross-browser compatible and to simplify integration.

To use jQuery.Syntax with minimal work, simply review the examples and use the files in the public sub-directory.

For more advanced usage and customisation, you will need to install the following dependencies to use jQuery.Syntax:
	$ sudo gem install rake haml

To install jQuery.Syntax into the standard 'public' directory
	$ rake install

To customise the install process, including destination directory and theme, edit <tt>install.yaml</tt>.

jQuery.Syntax depends on jQuery 1.4.1+.
